# trainstream-editor

This is an editor for the [TrainStream GitHub repository](https://github.com/TrainStream/trainstream.github.io).

The project uses the existing GitHub APIs to update the relevant files in the repository, which will then trigger GitHub Pages to rebuild the website.

This allows more non-tech savvy users to try to update the website.
